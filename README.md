Title: AI‑Based Project Monitoring System integrated with Atlassian Jira

This project aims to design and develop an intelligent project monitoring system that leverages Artificial Intelligence to improve project tracking, risk prediction, and decision‑making. In modern software and organizational environments, managing multiple tasks, meeting deadlines, and ensuring accurate reporting can be challenging. Delays often occur due to poor visibility into progress, unrealistic status updates, or inefficient resource utilization. This system addresses these challenges by providing a smart platform that continuously monitors project activities and predicts potential risks before they impact delivery timelines.

The system integrates with Jira to collect real‑time project data such as task updates, status changes, timelines, activity logs, and team contributions. By analyzing this data along with factors like daily progress, working hours, and productivity patterns, the AI model evaluates whether a task or project is likely to miss its deadline. This predictive capability enables project managers to identify bottlenecks early and take proactive measures such as reallocating resources, adjusting schedules, or addressing performance issues.

A key feature of the system is its ability to detect false or unrealistic work reports. By comparing reported progress with actual activity trends and historical performance data, the platform can flag inconsistencies and notify managers. This promotes transparency, improves accountability, and ensures that project decisions are based on reliable information.

The system also provides interactive dashboards, visual analytics, and automated alerts that offer clear insights into project health, team productivity, and risk levels. These features help stakeholders understand the current status of projects at a glance and support data‑driven planning. Additionally, the platform encourages better collaboration by maintaining activity logs and performance metrics that can be reviewed for continuous improvement.

Overall, this project demonstrates how combining AI techniques with project management tools can transform traditional monitoring into a proactive and intelligent process. The proposed solution not only helps in preventing delays but also enhances efficiency, optimizes team performance, and supports successful project delivery in dynamic and fast‑paced environments.
